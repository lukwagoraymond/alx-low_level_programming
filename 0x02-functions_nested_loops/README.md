# 0x02. C - Functions, nested loops 
## Tasks 
0. ### putchar
Write a program that prints **putchar**, followed by a new line\
- The program should return **0**
1. ### I sometimes suffer from insomia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line\ 
- Prototype: **void-print__alphabet(void)**
- You can only use puthcar twice in your code 
2. ### 10 x alphabet 
Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line\ 
- Prototype: **void print__alphabet__x10(void);**
- You can only use putchar twice in your code
3. ### islower
Write a function that checks for lowercase character\
- Prototype: **int__islower(int );**
- Returns **1** if **c** is lowercase
- Returns **0** otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function **islower**. Run man **islower** to learn more\ 
4. ### isalpha 
Write a function that checks for alpabetic character\
- Prototype: **int__isalpha(int c);**
- Returns **1** if **c** is a better, lowercase or uppercase
- Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: **isalpha**. Run **man isalpha** to learn more\ 
5. ### Sign 
Write a function that prints the sign of a number\
- Prototype: **int print__sign(int n);**
- Returns **1** and prints **+** if **n** is greater than zero
- Returns **0** and prints **0** if n is zero 
- Returns **-1** and prints **-** if **n** is less than zero
6. ### There is no such thing as absolute value in this world. You can only estimate what a thing is worth to you
Write a function that computes the absolute value of an integer\
- Prototype: **int__abs(int);**
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: **abs**. Rund **man abs** to learn more\
7. ### There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important.
Write a function that prints that the last digit of a number\
- Prototype: **int print__last__digit(int);**
- Returns the value of the last digit
8. ### I'm federal agent Jack Bauer, and today is the longest day of my life
Write a function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59\
- Prototype **void jack__bauer(void);**
- You can listen to this soundtrack while coding:)
9. ### Learn your times table 
Write a function that prints the 9 times, starting with 0\
- Prototype **void times__table(void);**
- Format: see example
10. ### a + b 
Write a function that adds two integers and returns the result\
- Prototype: **int add(int, int);**
11. 98 Battery Street, the OG 
Write a function that prints all natural numbers from **n** to **98**, followed by a new line\.
- Prototype **void print__to__98(int n);**
- Number must be separated by a comma, followed by a space
- Number should be printed in order
- The first printed number should be the number passed to your function
- The last printed number should be **98**
- You are allowed to use the standard library
