## Project 0x14. C-\ Bit Manipulation

This programme consists of five mandatory Tasks and two advanced Tasks only

### Tasks
0. **0**
Write a function that converts a binary number to an `unsigned int`.<br>
- Prototype: `unsigned int binary_to_uint(const char *b);`
1. **1**
Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number.<br>
- Prototype: `void print_binary(unsigned long int n);`
2. **10**
Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.<br>
- Prototype: `int get_bit(unsigned long int n, unsigned int index)`
3. **11**
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `1` at a given index.<br>
- Prototype: `int set_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);`
4. **100**
Write a function that sets the value of a bit to `0` at a given index.<br>
- Prototype: `int clear_bit(unsigned long int *n, unsigned int index);`
5. **101**
Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.<br>
- Prototype: `vunsigned int flip_bits(unsigned long int n, unsigned long int m);`
