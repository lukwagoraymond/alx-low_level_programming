## Project 0x0D. \-Structures, typedef
This programme consists of six mandatory Tasks only
### Tasks
0. **Poppy**\
Define a new type *struct dog* with the following elements.<br>
- *name*, type = _char\*_
- *age*, type = *float*
- *owner*,type = _char\*_
1. **A dog is the only thing on earth that loves you more than you love yourself**\
Write a function that initialise a variable of type *struct dog*.<br>
- Prototype: *void init\_dog(struct dog \*d, char \*name, float age, char \*owner);*
2. **A dog will teach you unconditional love. If you can have that in your life, things won't be too bad**\
Write a function that prints a *struct dog*.<br>
- Prototype: *void print\_dog(struct dog *d);*
3. **Outside of a dog, a book is a man's bet friend. inside of a dog it's too dark to read**\
Define a new type *dog_t* as a new name for the type *struct dog*.<br>
4. **A door is what a dog is perpetually on the wrong side of**\
Write a function that creates a new dog.<br>
- Prototype: *dog\_t *new\_dog(char \*name, float age, char \*owner);*
5. **How many leges does a dog have if you call tail a leg? Four. Saying that a tail is a leg doesn't make it a leg**\
Write a function that frees dogs.<br>
- Prototype: _void free\_dog(dog\_t \*d);_
